# sudoku-solver-scala

Sudoku solver written for the sake of practice and also to solve that one hard sudoku I didn't want to solve manually.

Solves simple cases (this value can be only here, here can be only one value), does kinda deep-first search if that's not enough.

## Usage

No practical usage is intended so no interface for it. You have to hardcode sudoku you want to solve in src/main/scala/app/App.scala and compile/run the app to see the result.

Please open an issue if you're going to use it and you need some real interface.
